            <strong>— W.B. Smith</strong>
            <br><br>
            Get ready to unlock the mathematics that describes our changing world—from the motion of planets to the growth of populations, from the optimization of profits to the flow of fluids. This year, you'll develop the tools to analyze change and accumulation in ways that have revolutionized science, engineering, and economics.

    <!-- Page 2: What is Calculus? -->
    <div class="page page-break">
        <h1>What is Calculus?</h1>
        
        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p>Calculus was independently developed in the late 17th century by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Newton needed it to describe planetary motion and physics, while Leibniz developed it to solve optimization problems. Their work built upon earlier contributions from mathematicians like Fermat, Descartes, and others who worked on tangent lines and areas under curves.</p>
        
        <h2>The Two Main Branches</h2>
        
        <h3>Derivatives (Differential Calculus)</h3>
        <p>Derivatives measure <strong>instantaneous rates of change</strong>. Think of it as finding the exact speed of a car at a specific moment, or the steepness of a curve at a particular point.</p>
        <div class="math-example">
            The derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ is $f'(x) = 2x$
            <br>This tells us the slope of the parabola at any point $x$.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Integrals (Integral Calculus)</h3>
        <p>Integrals measure <strong>accumulation</strong>. They help us find areas under curves, total distances traveled, or the total amount of something that's changing over time.</p>
        <div class="math-example">
            $\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \frac{8}{3}$
            <br>This gives us the area under the curve $y = x^2$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Describing motion, forces, and energy</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Optimizing designs and analyzing systems</li>
            <li><strong>Economics:</strong> Marginal cost, profit maximization</li>
            <li><strong>Medicine:</strong> Drug dosage calculations, population models</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Machine learning algorithms, computer graphics</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Purpose of Learning Calculus</h2>
        <p>Calculus teaches you to think about <em>change</em> and <em>accumulation</em> in precise, mathematical ways. It's the foundation for advanced mathematics, science, and engineering. More importantly, it develops your problem-solving skills and mathematical reasoning.</p>

        <h1>Investigation Debrief & Key Insights</h1>
        
        <h2>Partner Sharing</h2>
        <p>Each pair will briefly share one key observation from their investigation. Focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What you discovered about rates of change</li>
            <li>Which scenario was most interesting or surprising</li>
            <li>Connections you made between the three situations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h2>What You Just Discovered</h2>
            <p>Congratulations! You've just explored the fundamental concept behind <strong>derivatives</strong>:</p>
            
            <h3>🚗 Speed is the derivative of position</h3>
            <p>The car's changing speed told you how position was changing at each moment.</p>
            
            <h3>🦠 Growth rate is the derivative of population</h3>
            <p>The bacteria's growth rate told you how quickly the population was changing.</p>
            
            <h3>💰 Marginal profit is the derivative of profit</h3>
            <p>The rate of profit change told you whether selling one more item would increase or decrease profits.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Big Idea</h2>
        <div class="math-example">
            <p><strong>A derivative measures how quickly one quantity changes with respect to another.</strong></p>
            <p>In mathematical terms: If $y = f(x)$, then the derivative $f'(x)$ tells us the instantaneous rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Understanding derivatives allows us to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimize:</strong> Find maximum profits, minimum costs, fastest routes</li>
            <li><strong>Predict:</strong> Determine when populations will grow fastest or when objects will reach maximum height</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> Adjust systems to achieve desired rates of change</li>
            <li><strong>Understand:</strong> Analyze how the world around us changes</li>

            <h2>🔍 Tomorrow's Big Question</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
                "If derivatives tell us about rates of change,<br>
                what do integrals tell us about?"
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Preview: The Flip Side of Calculus</h2>
        <p>Today you discovered that derivatives help us understand <em>how fast</em> things change. Tomorrow, we'll explore integrals, which help us understand <em>how much</em> things accumulate over time.</p>
        
        <h3>🤔 Think About This Tonight:</h3>
        <div class="investigation-box">
            <p>Imagine you're driving a car and you know your speed at every moment during a trip. Could you figure out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How far you traveled in total?</li>
                <li>How much gas you used?</li>
                <li>The total time you spent accelerating?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Hint: This is exactly what integrals help us calculate!</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hands-on activity:</strong> Estimating areas under curves</li>
            <li><strong>Real-world connections:</strong> Distance, area, volume, and more</li>
            <li><strong>The Fundamental Theorem:</strong> How derivatives and integrals are connected</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="math-example">
            <h3>Sneak Peek: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</h3>
            <p>Derivatives and integrals are actually <em>inverse operations</em>—they undo each other!</p>
            <p>If $F'(x) = f(x)$, then $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$</p>
            <p><em>Don't worry about the details yet—we'll build up to this amazing connection!</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Tonight's Reflection</h2>
        <p>No formal homework, but think about these questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Where in your daily life do you notice things accumulating over time?</li>
            <li>How might knowing total accumulation be useful in the scenarios we explored today?</li>
            <li>What questions do you have about calculus after today's introduction?</li>
        </ol>
